Something I learned doing this assignment:
	I learned a lot about HMM models and how to train them. I also learned how
	to read and write to text files and how to execute a python files from another
	python file.


Biggest challange I faced doing this assignment:
	The biggest challange I faced during this assignment was debugging especially with
	the larger data sets. As the size of the data set grew, the time it took to run the 
	program grew exponentially, and every edit I made to the code would take 10-15 mins to 
	run and test properly.
